Code examples for real-time testing of OpenJDK and the Fiji VM on the Raspberry Pi

Contents:

./Java
  -OpenJDK examples
  
./Fiji
  -Fiji examples
  
Notes:
This requires the installation of the Raspberry Pi cross compiler (and assumes this is done on Ubuntu). Instructions for the cross compiler can be found at: http://hertaville.com/2012/09/28/development-environment-raspberry-pi-cross-compiler/

This also requires the installation of the Fiji VM and associated tools. Contact Fiji Systems (fiji-systems.com) for use.
